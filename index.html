    <h1>Dance</h1>

    <div class="callout">
      "Dance, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and
      within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion,
      releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself. Dance
      is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by
      skillful performers into something that becomes intensely expressive and
      that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves."
